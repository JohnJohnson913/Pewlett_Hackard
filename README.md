#  Overview of the analysis:

Pewlett Hackard is company on the brink of a significant employee shift.  Many of the employees are nearing their retirement age, leaving the company in situation that will require a hiring wave of new talent.  Due to the significant gap in knowledge that will walk out the door, the organization is preparing
for this change by identifying candidates that could function as mentors to the large group of newly hired employees.  So, not only is it necessary to gauge the volume of indivduals that could retire, it's also important to find a group of experienced employees that will serve as mentors to the new
group of employees when that time comes.

#  Results:

We will begin with the findings from the investigation of who is elibigle for retirement.  The organization currently stands at to lose a significant volume of employees.  

 - The most significant volume of employees that are at risk of leaving the company are the engineering department at 45,397 employees.  This would land a significant blow to the department, not only from a capacity standpoint, but also from a tribal knowledge standpoint.

 - Though we have roughly 670 individuals that could be utilzzed to mentor individuals from the retirement wave, it's not enough to fully engage new talent to replace the knowledge walking out the door.  Additional recommendation will be needed.

 - Not far behind the engineering department is the staff department.  Currently we could see 40,497 individuals leave from these roles.  Even though these may not seem as critical as losing the engineering staff, they do provide a critical role.  
 - As much like with the engineering department	we only have 724 individuals from the staff level positions.  This again is short of the numbers needed to provide a adaqueate level of mentorship to incoming employees.


#  Summary:

In a situation like what we are seeing there are likelying going to need to be more recommendations beyond simply a mentorship program.  

  1.  The overall volume of employees who could potentially retire currently stands at 90,398 individuals.  Simply a stagering amount of knowledge leaving the company.  

  2.  Currently, our analysis shows that we will only have 1,549 individuals who will be able to mentor new individuals entering the company.   In my opinion these are are not enough individuals to be available to mentor the newly hired employees.  My quick math shows that each mentor would 
      need to have just under 60 meeting a week to provide feedback and guidance.  However, if we include employees also born in 1964 the numbers increase greatly.  We could increase our potential mentorship program to nearly 20,000 employees. 
      Employees born in 1965 just don't account for enough individuals to support the plan.  Including individuals from 1964 birthdates would include employees in enough volume to account for the necessary mentor staff to suppport our needs. I've supplied a screenshot of an additional table showing the increase in 
      the volumes of individuals born in 1964.
